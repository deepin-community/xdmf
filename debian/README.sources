The upstream source code package contains software (Utilities/metis/*) that does not ship
with a  free software license. Hence it has been excluded from this package.
.
Other software, such as HDF5, that is shipped separately within Debian is shipped with this
package but not built; the main Debian version is linked instead, as per Debian policy.
